Путем составления сводных таблиц в соответсвии со значениями корреляционной матрицы были заполнены многочисленные пропуски в данных. После ликвидации всех пропусков и кодировки признаков было обучено несколько моделей для предсказания метрики RMSE, так же был осуществлён подбор гиперпараметров для получения более хороших результатов, лучший результат удалось получить модели градиентного бустинга - CatBoostRegressor, со значением метрики RMSE 1557.64.
